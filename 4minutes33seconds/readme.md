4 Minutes 33 seconds is a processing program that was inspired by John Cage's 4'33'' 

The program runs for 4'33'' and it is a dot that moves in a random direction. Similarly to the experience people go through at John Cage's 4'33'' performances, each run through of the program is different and unique to only that run.
