This folder is from my time at SFSU Art 699 self-study course where I incorporated art into coding.

The most noteable piece is 4'33''.

4'33'' was inspired by John Cage's 4'33''. I coded a piece that would be a visual unlike his audible piece. As you never know what to expect during your experience with John Cage's 4'33'', same goes for this one. You never know what you will see. 

Below is a gif of the sketch fast forwarded.
